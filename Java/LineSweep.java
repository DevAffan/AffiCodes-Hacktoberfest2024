To solve this problem we will use line sweep algorithm but first take a look at what it does:
The Line Sweep Algorithm is a powerful and efficient method for solving a variety of problems, particularly those involving intervals, geometric objects, or event-based data processing. The technique works by simulating the movement of a line across a plane or along a timeline, and processing events (such as interval starts, interval ends, or other key points) as they occur in a specific order.

Key Steps of the Line Sweep Algorithm:
Event Definition:

The algorithm identifies critical events, which could be the start or end of an interval, or other changes in the state of the system (e.g., the appearance or disappearance of an object).
For example, if dealing with intervals (like flower blooming times or line segments), the events are the points where intervals begin or end.
Sorting the Events:

The events are sorted based on their position (e.g., starting or ending times for intervals, or x/y-coordinates for geometrical objects).
Sorting ensures that the line processes the events in a meaningful order, from smallest to largest along the relevant dimension (e.g., time or x-axis).
Sweeping the Line:

A conceptual line "sweeps" across the events, processing them one by one.
As the line encounters each event, it updates relevant information. For example, when it hits the start of an interval, it may increase a count of active intervals, and when it reaches the end, it decreases that count.
The algorithm can perform real-time calculations based on the current state of the system at any point along the sweep.
Processing Each Event:

For each event, some state is updated:
In interval problems, you may update the number of active intervals.
In geometric problems, you might update which objects are intersecting or overlapping.
The key to efficiency is that you don't revisit or check every event with every other event; instead, you process them as they occur during the sweep, which allows for a more direct solution.
Example Problem:
Counting Overlapping Intervals
Suppose you have multiple intervals representing flower blooming times. You want to know how many flowers are blooming at each time that a person visits.

Define Events:

Each flower's blooming period creates two events: one when it starts blooming and one when it stops (end + 1).
Sort Events:

Sort the start and end events by time.
Sweep the Line:

Start a counter at 0.

Continuing the explanation of counting overlapping intervals using the Line Sweep Algorithm:

Sweep the Line (cont.):

As you encounter a start event (when a flower begins blooming), you increment the counter since one more flower is blooming.
When you encounter an end event (when a flower stops blooming), you decrement the counter, because one less flower is blooming.
By keeping track of these changes in the count, you can know exactly how many flowers are blooming at any point in time.

Processing Each Event:

At each event (whether it's a start or end), the counter of blooming flowers is updated.
For each person's visit time, you can determine how many flowers are blooming by checking the counter at the appropriate moment during the sweep.
Result:

The algorithm gives the exact count of overlapping intervals (or blooming flowers) at each person's visit without having to check every interval for every person, which would be inefficient. Instead, it processes the events in a linear fashion, making it much faster.
Key Points:
Efficiency: Instead of comparing every interval or event with every other event (which could take O(n^2) time), the line sweep algorithm processes the events in O(n log n) time due to the sorting step, followed by a linear scan.
State Tracking: The algorithm maintains a running "state" (like the number of active intervals or objects) as it sweeps through events.
