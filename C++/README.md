# C++ : Algorithms and Problem Solutions

Welcome to the **C++** repository! This repository includes various C++ algorithms and problem-solving solutions, making it easier for learners and contributors to understand key concepts in algorithms and apply them to real-world problems.

## Repository Structure

The repository is divided into two main sections: **Algorithms** and **Problem Solutions**. Each folder contains C++ files relevant to its category, with each file named according to the algorithm or problem solved.

Here is the structure:

1. **Algorithms**
   - **Sorting**: Includes sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort.
   - **Searching**: Contains algorithms such as Binary Search and Linear Search.

2. **Problem Solutions**
   - **Arrays**: Solutions to common array-based problems such as finding duplicates and the maximum subarray sum.
   - **Strings**: Covers string manipulation problems like reversing a string and finding the longest palindrome.
   - **Dynamic Programming**: Solutions to dynamic programming problems such as the Knapsack problem and calculating the Fibonacci sequence efficiently.

## Features

- **Well-Documented Code**: All files are well-commented to enhance understanding.
- **Test Cases**: Many of the solutions include test cases to validate the code.
- **Optimized Solutions**: Each algorithm is optimized for performance where applicable.

## Installation and Usage

To use the algorithms and problem solutions in this repository, first clone the repository. You can compile and run any `.cpp` file using a C++ compiler like `g++`.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the folder containing the algorithm or solution you want to run.
3. Compile the C++ file using a compiler (e.g., g++), then run the compiled file.

For example, to run a sorting algorithm, you can compile the sorting file and execute the output file.
