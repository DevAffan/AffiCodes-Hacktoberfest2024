                                                              2D ARRAYS


2D arrays efficiently store and manage grid-like data structures,
making them ideal for representing matrices, tables, or images.

Here are a few beginner-friendly points explaining the need for 2D arrays:

1.Storing tabular data: 2D arrays allow you to store data in rows and columns, making it easier to represent grids, matrices,
or tables (e.g., a chessboard or a spreadsheet).

2. Efficient access: 2D arrays allow direct access to elements using row and column indices, providing an organized way to
work with multi-dimensional data.

3. Multi-dimensional problems: They are essential for solving problems like matrix operations, image processing, or graph 
traversal, where two dimensions naturally represent the data.

4. Space-efficient: Instead of creating multiple 1D arrays, a 2D array consolidates data into a single structure, reducing 
complexity and improving memory management.
