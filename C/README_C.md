# AffiCodes # C Projects - Hacktoberfest 2024!

This folder contains C programming projects designed for students and beginners eager to learn about algorithms, data structures, and fundamental C programming concepts.

## Overview

The C folder contains several programs that demonstrate both fundamental and advanced concepts in C programming. This includes basic algorithms, sorting techniques, data structures like linked lists and trees, recursion, and various utility programs. These projects are designed to help you learn and practice essential C programming skills.

## Instructions for Compiling and Running the Code

To compile and run any of the C programs in this folder, follow the instructions below:

1. Navigate to the folder where the .c file is located:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/c_projects

2.Compile the code using the gcc compiler:
    ```bash
    gcc -o output_filename source_filename.c


### Prerequisites
1. **Install GCC**: Ensure that you have the GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) installed on your system. You can check if it's installed by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   gcc --version
