# Wikipedia bot in Python #

ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!

## About the project ##

This is a simple Wikipedia surfing bot in Python made with the wikipedia library. It allows the user to search for a topic and choose between the articles related to it. Once the user has chosen the article, it provides the link to the article and summarizes it in a line.

## Installation and use ##

1) Install the dependency

```pip3 install wikipedia```

2) Run the application

```python3 Wikipedia_bot.py```

3) Happy learning!

## Bugs and improvements ###

1) When trying to load the page of some articles, the program encounters a disambiguation error that suggests some other(totally unrelated) articles. I can't seem to fix it(found a workaround tho). Any help is appreciated!

2) This app could definitely use a GUI
