## 🧮 Example Algorithm

### Binary Search

- **File**: `binarySearch.php`
- **Description**: Performs binary search on a sorted array to find the index of the target element.
- **Usage**:
    ```PHP
    function binarySearch($arr, $x) {
    $low = 0;
    $high = count($arr) - 1;

    while ($low <= $high) {
        $mid = floor(($low + $high) / 2);

        if ($arr[$mid] == $x) {
            return $mid;
        }

        if ($arr[$mid] < $x) {
            $low = $mid + 1;
        } else {
            $high = $mid - 1;
        }
    }
    return -1;
   }
    $result = binarySearch([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 4);
    echo $result; // Output: 3
    ```
